# adding a game
super easy:
1. Create a class for your game which extends Game
2. Implement the functions from Game
3. Register your game in GameType
4. Add all your custom stuffs related to the game in your game class, populate the inherited functions
5. Open Minecraft, run /game set -yourgame-, then /game start, and profit!

note: encouraged to draw on the utils provided by Twilight, and also NoteblockAPI is there to play music with 5 Christmas songs already provided in the run folder

many more things to do, including:
- add a game countdown
- make NPCs work and add leaderboard NPCs
- make sidebar
- lobby games
- decorate tree commands

**I HAVE PROVIDED THE MAP USED FOR TESTING GAMES IN THE RUN FOLDER. REMEMBER YOU CAN RUN THE SERVER USING RUN SERVER TASK IN THE GRADLE PANE!**

enjoy!
